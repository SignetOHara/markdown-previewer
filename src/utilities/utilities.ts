## Project 2 - Markdown Previewer

[Here are the project instructions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)

We can add inline code between two backticks: \`<h1>Hello</h1>\`

We can also use a code block:

\`\`\`
const hellothere = () => console.log('Hello there!');
\`\`\`

**This is bold text**

- A list
- Second item

> Block Quotes!

And an image:
